# Hydrogen orbital isosurfaces

Â© 2020 Lee-Ping Wang and Department of Chemistry, University of California, Davis. All rights reserved.

This Jupyter notebook was written for CHE 110A, Fall 2020.  It uses Sympy to define the hydrogen atom wavefunctions and PyVista for plotting isosurfaces.

How to use: 

1. Evaluate the cell directly below this one to import the libraries and define functions.  If you're interested in coding, feel free to read through the code to get a better handle on what's going on.

2. Set the *n*, *l*, and *m* quantum numbers (be sure that 0 < *l* < *n*, and -*l* < *m* < +*l*), and then evaluate the next cell.  The three-dimensional plot should appear.  Click the "three bars" in the upper left to set the color map, opacity, change the viewpoint, etc.

Note: In the interactive plot, the colors of the x, y, and z axes are red, yellow and green respectively.
